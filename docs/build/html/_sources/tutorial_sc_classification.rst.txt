Tutorial 2: scRNA-seq + Classification Analysis
====================================================================

This tutorial demonstrates a complete workflow for integrating single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data with bulk RNA-seq data to perform a "Classification" analysis.

The example uses Melanoma (SKCM) data to identify cell populations associated with immunotherapy response.
